# AI-Physical & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Conciseness and Technical Accuracy
All content MUST be concise, technically accurate, and aligned with real-world robotics engineering.

### II. Modularity and Structure
Content MUST be modular and maintain a logical structure.

### III. Thematic Focus
Content MUST focus strictly on AI-physical systems and humanoid robotics topics.

### IV. Consistent Terminology
Consistent terminology MUST be maintained throughout the book.

## Additional Guidelines
Adherence to established scientific and engineering practices is required. All examples and case studies must be verifiable and directly relevant to the core subject matter.

## Review and Quality Assurance
All content undergoes technical review to ensure accuracy and alignment with principles. Regular checks for conciseness, modularity, and thematic consistency are mandatory.

## Governance
Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal and approval by the project lead. All contributors MUST adhere to these principles.
